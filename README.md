# NetPro

In this work, we propose a new neighborhood interaction-based method named NetPro, to identify potential associations between drugs and diseases via label propagation. The NetPro program is implemented in Matlab2018a. 

"Demo_NetPro.m" demonstrates the experimental result on the PREDICT dataset by NetPro. 

The other two benchmark datasets Cdataset and LRSSL can be found in the "Datasets" folder.

All files of Dataset and Code should be stored in the same folder to run NetPro.

If you have any questions or suggestions with the code, please let us know.
